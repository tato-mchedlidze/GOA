It handles logic, data, and communication with the database.

Types of Backend:

• API backend – provides data to the frontend through APIs


Protocol
A protocol is a set of rules that computers use to communicate.

Types of Protocols:

• FTP – used to transfer files
• TCP/IP – base protocol of the internet


Request
A request is a message sent from the frontend to the server.


Response
A response is the answer sent from the server back to the frontend.


Database
A database is a place where data is stored.


Types of Databases:
• SQL – data stored in tables (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Connection between Frontend, Server, and Database
The frontend sends a request to the server.
The server processes the request and gets data from the database.
The server sends a response back to the frontend.
